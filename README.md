**Open Samplr** - An open-source version of the SamplrBot for Telegram.  
If you just want to use it, send `/start` to [SamplrBot](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@SamplrBot).

Samplr was inspired by the concept discussed in this [podcast episode](https://www.manager-tools.com/2023/01/compress-your-work-double-your-time-part-1). The idea is to track your daily work by setting an alarm every 15 minutes and logging what youâ€™re doing. Samplr automates this process through Telegram, making it easier and more convenient.
